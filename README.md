# CLT Tool Box
### Executive Statement
*A demo website (WIP) to offer management as a replacement/improvement to existing paper processes and/or the combination of many separated utilities used by Manufacturing. The intent is to simplify and create of sort of one-stop-shop for all of our Manufacturing Operators' needs.*

#### The current plan is to include at least the following:
1. An Output Log to replace paper sheets currently in use.
2. An FTO Request form and/or calender.
3. A performance profile for operators to view their personal performance and receive feedback from their managers and/or coworkers (similar to a user forum).
4. Issue tracker (Intended for Operator-to-Operator notices, but may also be adapted for work orders to replace paper submissions).

*While Django is in use, no backend logic, or a bare minimum of such will be written until approval to build the project is given. Its current state will remain purely demonstrative.*
